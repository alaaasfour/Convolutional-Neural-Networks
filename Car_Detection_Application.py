"""
In this script, we will implement object detection using the very powerful YOLO (You Only Look Once) model.
In this script, we will do the following:
    - Detect objects in a car detection dataset
    - Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy
    - Implement intersection over union
    - Handle bounding boxes, a type of image annotation popular in deep learning

Let's assume we are working on a self-driving car project. The purpose of this script is to build a car detection system.
To collect data, we've mounted a camera to the hood of the car, which takes pictures of the road ahead every few seconds as we drive around.

You've gathered all these images into a folder and labelled them by drawing bounding boxes around every car you found.

Exercise 1: YOLO Model
"You Only Look Once" (YOLO) is a popular algorithm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real time. 
This algorithm "only looks once" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. 
After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.

Inputs and Outputs
    - The input is a batch of images, and each image has the shape (608, 608, 3)
    - The output is a list of bounding boxes along with the recognized classes. Each bounding box is represented by 6 numbers  
    (ùëùùëê,ùëèùë•,ùëèùë¶,ùëè‚Ñé,ùëèùë§,ùëê). If we expand ùëê into an 80-dimensional vector, each bounding box is then represented by 85 numbers.

We will implement the yolo_filter_boxes() function as follows:
1. Compute box scores by doing the elementwise product
2. For each box we will find:
    - the index of the class with the maximum box score
    - the corresponding box score
    - Create a mask by using a threshold. The mask should be `True` for the boxes we want to keep.
    - Use TensorFlow to apply the mask to `box_class_scores`, `boxes` and `box_classes` to filter out the boxes we don't want.
Argument:
    boxes: tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 4)
    box_confidence: tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 1)
    box_class_probs: tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 80)
    threshold: real value, if [ highest class probability score < threshold], then get rid of the corresponding box

Returns:
    scores: tensor of shape (None,), containing the class probability score for selected boxes
    boxes: tensor of shape (None, 4), containing (b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w) coordinates of selected boxes
    classes: tensor of shape (None,), containing the index of the class detected by the selected boxes
